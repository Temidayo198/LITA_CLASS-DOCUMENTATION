### Project Overview
---

The project aims to provide data-driven insights into key employee attributes within the company, helping the HR department better understand patterns of attrition, employee demographics, and job satisfaction. This analysis will support strategic HR decisions, including retention strategies, employee engagement, and career development initiatives.

### Data Sources
---
The data utilized in this project was generated by the faclitator for instructional purposes and reflects hypothetical staff details. The data was designed to simulate real world scheduling scenerios, allowing for practical application of PowerBi functions.

### Tool Used 
---
- PowerBI
  
1. Data Integration
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Visualization

###  Data Analysis Process
---

Data Integration: This involve connecting to various data sources, including Excel, SQL Server, Azure, SharePoint, or cloud-based services to get our data and making use of Power Query to clean, shape, and transform raw data before analysis by removing rows/columns, duplicates and also the use of conditional column to ensure data quality and consistency. This process is called Data transformation and the use of functions like **`TRIM`**, **`UPPER`**, **`LOWER`** help to improve data integrity.

Data Analysis: Utilize Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for creating custom calculations and measures that enhance data analysis.
- **Calculated Columns**: Add new data columns based on existing ones (e.g., calculating age from a birth date).
- **Measures**: Create metrics that calculate values dynamically based on user selections (e.g., total sales, average revenue).

Data Visualization: The use of various visual elements (charts, graphs, tables, cards) to represent data visually.

### Results
---

From the we observe that:

- Total Number of Current Employees is 1,233
- Attrition Rate (16%): This is a moderately high attrition rate, indicating that approximately 16% of employees have left the company within a specific timeframe.
- Average Age of Employees (37): This suggests a middle-aged workforce, which can impact succession planning and future recruitment strategies.
- High Attrition Rate: The attrition rate is 16%, which could be considered high depending on the industry and organization. This suggests a significant turnover of employees.
- Attrition by Department: R&D has the highest attrition count at 56%, followed by Sales at 39%. This indicates that employees in these departments are more likely to leave, which may point to issues such as high workload, lack of job satisfaction, or better opportunities elsewhere.
- Attrition by Education: Employees with qualifications in Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing seem to have the highest attrition counts. This may point to role-specific challenges, unique pressures, unmet career expectations or better external opportunities for these qualifications.
- Attrition by Gender: The attrition rate is higher for males (63%) compared to females (37%), which might reflect specific challenges or dynamics affecting male employees more significantly in this organization.
- Attrition by Age Groups: The majority of attrition is occurring in younger age groups, particularly under 25 and the 25-34 age bracket. Younger employees may leave for career advancement, higher salaries, or because they are early in their careers and exploring different opportunities.
- Job Satisfaction Across Roles:
Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists appear to have higher dissatisfaction rates. In particular, Research Scientists and Sales Executives have a high count of "Dissatisfied" and "Very Dissatisfied" employees.
Healthcare Representatives, on the other hand, have a significant number of employees who are "Very Satisfied."
- Marital Status and Gender Breakdown:
Married male employees represent the largest group (348 employees), followed by single male employees (198) and married female employees (241).
Divorced employees, both male and female, are among the smallest groups, which could indicate fewer employees in that demographic or potentially lower retention.

### Recommendations
---

- Address High Attrition in Sales and R&D and Dissatisfaction in Specific Role:
Conduct exit interviews or surveys to understand the reasons for high turnover and role dissatisfaction in these departments. Consider improving working conditions, offering better incentives, or creating clearer career advancement pathways.

- Consider Revising HR Policies:
Based on findings from attrition trends, revising policies around workload, compensation, and recognition might help address root causes and improve retention.

- Review of Job Satisfaction for Male Employees:
The higher attrition rate among male employees suggests potential dissatisfaction. Conduct surveys or exit interviews to understand underlying reasons and address any concerns specific to male employees.

- Regular Monitoring and Feedback Mechanisms:
Implement a system to regularly monitor employee satisfaction across departments, age groups, and genders. This can help detect issues early and take preventive actions to avoid high turnover.

### Conclusion
---

The data indicates several key areas where employee satisfaction and retention can be improved. High attrition rates, particularly in the Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing fields, suggest that certain departments may be experiencing challenges that drive employees to seek opportunities elsewhere. Dissatisfaction is also notably high among specific roles, such as Research Scientists, Sales Executives, and Laboratory Technicians, highlighting potential issues with job satisfaction and engagement within these positions.

The demographic analysis reveals that married male employees form the largest portion of the workforce, emphasizing the importance of family-friendly policies to support work-life balance and enhance retention. Additionally, while roles like Healthcare Representatives demonstrate high satisfaction, other roles struggle, suggesting that satisfaction factors from more positive roles could be applied organization-wide.

To address these issues, the organization should focus on improving conditions in high-attrition and high-dissatisfaction roles, implementing targeted retention strategies for in-demand fields, and supporting diverse employee demographics with policies tailored to their needs. By addressing these areas, the organization can foster a more engaged, satisfied, and stable workforce.
