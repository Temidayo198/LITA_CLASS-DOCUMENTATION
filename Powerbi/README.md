###  Data Analysis Process
---

Data Integration: This involve connecting to various data sources, including Excel, SQL Server, Azure, SharePoint, or cloud-based services to get our data and making use of Power Query to clean, shape, and transform raw data before analysis by removing rows/columns, duplicates and also the use of conditional column to ensure data quality and consistency. This process is called Data transformation and the use of functions like **`TRIM`**, **`UPPER`**, **`LOWER`** help to improve data integrity.

Data Analysis: Utilize Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for creating custom calculations and measures that enhance data analysis.
- **Calculated Columns**: Add new data columns based on existing ones (e.g., calculating age from a birth date).
- **Measures**: Create metrics that calculate values dynamically based on user selections (e.g., total sales, average revenue).

Data Visualization: The use of various visual elements (charts, graphs, tables, cards) to represent data visually.
